        <h2 style="width:190px;position:relative;top:10px;">Jagatyam Jagat</h2>

            <p style="position:relative;top:2px;"> Why do people travel around? Have you ever asked this question to your fellow travellers? The answers might be different for different people. For some, its just a way of having fun. They take some days off from their busy schedules and go for a fun-packed trip with family and friends. They can be called the holiday travellers. You will come across another section who find travelling as a way of escaping from the pressure and anxieties their daily lives put them into. They might prefer travelling alone or with people with similar mindset. Then comes another class of hard-core trekkers who simply love the adventure and thrill the roads offer them. They are not usually concerned about the facilities and arrangements ready in a specific place and are ready to adjust with any kind of circumstances. All they want is that thrilling experience of struggles, sweat and pain which will lead them towards the beautiful and heavenly viewpoints in some very high altitude hill stations or hard-to-reach forest destinations. Then there are those who simply wander around from places to places. They don't have any specific destinations to aim for. Nor do they have any fixed plans. Some of them move around without having a single penny in their pockets. They simply want to be in this state of moving.</p>


<img title="The lonely wanderer" style="border:1px solid green;width:250px;height:300px;position:relative;left:400px;top:20px;" src="/photos/Home/Chris.jpeg" /><br /><br />

 <p> If you examine the history of mankind, you will find the stories of great explorers who crossed oceans and continents to see and learn about the unknown  lands. In fact there were 'Gotras' (Groups) who by profession, moved from one place to another throughout their lives. What might be the reason for this eternal thirst of mankind, from the shepherds to the great saints to move around and explore. Why struggle so much. In fact, many times a traveller come across situations where he asks himself " why on earth am I doing this?" "Why can't I be satisfied with a well planned secured pattern of life like most others, confirming to the society and its rules.. Why all these miseries and uncertainties?? " And occasionally the mind gives up and actually goes back to the ordinary way of life. But after a while, the thirst again becomes unbearable. And he sets out again.</p>

 <img title="The lonely wanderer" style="border:1px solid green;width:250px;height:300px;position:relative;left:400px;top:15px;" src="/photos/Home/wild.png"/><br /><br />


<p>Is it just the curiosity of human mind to learn about the unknown lands and cultures? If you go deeply into the roots of this wanting, you will find that this affinity is consciously or mostly unconsciously connected with man's eternal search for truths or answers. The ancient Indian philosophies declare that the very nature of human soul is freedom and bliss. It is not bound by places or patterns or rules. Yet in this world, man invariably finds himself getting tangled in all kinds of patterns, rules and laws. So he starts the struggle for breaking away from these chains. He moves around from places to places. Civilisations to civilisations.Thats the reason why Christopher John McCandless went to Alaska all alone without having a single penny in his pocket, putting his life in risk and eventually losing it. Newer experiences, newer circumstances bring forth man the glimpses of realisations and truths about the world and about himself. He sees that all these truths were known to him from the beginning but were hidden by some unknown veil. In fact as he moves around for a while, he discovers that its these truths themselves who were driving his quest and thirst. As he goes nearer to these facts, his mind starts becoming calmer and quieter. He realises that the whole world is involved in this struggle for freedom, knowingly or unknowingly. Constantly changing, constantly moving. Rearranging itself, reordering itself. Then restlessness gives way to peace, anxieties to tranquility. He gradually comes to the realisation that he himself was the truth he was searching for. All the bliss, all the peace, all the freedom were inherited by his soul. They were just hidden to him. Through the wanderings and explorations, actually he was struggling to establish his very nature. Limitless freedom.</p>

 <img title="Exploring within" style="border:1px solid green;width:250px;height:300px;position:relative;left:400px;top:15px;" src="/photos/Home/images-1.jpeg"/><br /><br />

<p>The website pages don't try to describe any of these philosophies related to different places. Nor does it try and teach you how to feel those feelings. The reason is simple. You can't teach anyone how to feel. You just feel. Thats it. And more importantly, these are not new thoughts. All these thoughts and feelings were experienced by mankind generations after generations. The website simply gives some directions to travellers visiting different places. The main focus is given to those who travel with not much in there pockets to spend. So be open to all the experiences on the way. And keep moving.</p>

<template name="task1" id="gangotri">
               <h2 style="width:150px;position:relative;top:10px;">Gangotri</h2>

<p style="position:relative;top:2px;"><b>Gangotri</b> is considered to be one of the holiest pilgrim centers in India. It is one of the 'Chota Char Dhams' (Four holy places. The other three being Yamunotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath). Gangotri is around <b>275 km</b> away from Rishikesh which is the nearest railway station and around <b>105 km</b> from Uttar Kashi which often acts as the camping center between Rishikesh and Gangotri for travellers. It takes around 7.5 hours by bus to reach Gangotri from Rishikesh an around 2.5 hours from Uttar Kashi. You can see the Ganges at its most fearsome form in Gangotri when it originates from the  Gangotri glacier at Gaumukh and comes roaring down the hill to flow though its channel towards Rishikesh and all. The devotees consider it as one of the holiest things to do to have a dip in the sacred Ganges and then have the 'darsan' of Ganga Maiyya (Mother Ganga) in Gangotri. The water in the Ganges is extremely cold  as it is freshly coming down from the himalayas. Gangotri temple and the pilgrimage opens for visitors by <b>May 9th</b> on the auspicious day of Akshay Tritiya and closes for winter on Vijaya Dhasami day which falls in the month of November every year. Devotees from all over the world come to the temple of river Ganga for the worship on these auspicious days. You will find lot of sadhus and devotees walking from distant places to reach Gangotri.</p>

<p>Other than the temple, Gangotri gives you exciting opportunities to trek and explore. There are two breathtaking Kunds (water falling into a deep and surrounded region), which are <b>Surya Kund</b> and <b>Gauri Kund</b>. You can trek along the trails of river passing the temple and explore as long as you want. Another exciting as well as a little bit dangerous trek is the Kedar Tal route. The local people advise you to do the Kedar Tal trek only with the help of a local guide since there is a chance of you getting lost on the way up and there are no sign boards. </p>
<p> Gangotri is the base for <b>Gaumukh</b>, which is the origin point of the holy river Ganga. You need to climb <b>19 km</b> from Gangotri to reach Gaumukh and the view of the glacier and its surroundings is simply heavenly. You will feel the purity and auspiciousness of existence by merely being in that environment for some time. The climbing can get a little difficult sometimes especially when it is raining. Some travellers start the trek by afternoon, reach Gaumukh by evening, and spend the night there before climbing down next morning although you should be prepared with warm clothes and other equipments to cope with the extreme cold on top.</p>
         
              <h3>How to reach:</h3>

             
<p><b>Rishikesh</b> is the base city and nearest railway station for most of your expeditions towards this part of the world. It is recommended to split the journey from Rishikesh to Gangotri into two<b>:</b> Rishikesh to Uttar Kashi(170 km) and Uttar Kashi to Gangotri(105km)- for two reasons.</p>
 <ul><li>It gives you an opportunity to take rest in Uttar kashi and explore the region</li>
<li>It helps you avoid the possibility of travelling in the route during late evening as there is a chance of you getting stuck on the road due to sudden landslides, especially during rainy seasons.</li></ul>
<p> You will get public as well as private buses from Rishikesh bus stand to Uttar Kashi (fare is 240 Rs/-) . Shared cabs are also running in this route which will charge 300 Rs/- per person. Note that the buses as well as the taxis stop their service before 2 pm.

        There are limited state transport corporation buses conducting their services from Uttar Kashi to Gangotri (Fare is around 150 Rs/-). The first bus leaves by 7 AM. You can check the timings in the local bus depot which is in the Uttar Kashi town center. There are shared cabs running in this route as well which start their services from early morning (fare is 200 Rs/- per person).</p>

You can hire private taxis as well from both Rishikesh and Uttar Kashi.

        
         
         
               <h3>Accommodation & Food:</h3>
            

<p>Unlike Rishikesh and Uttar kashi, Gangotri does not have too many ashrams although there are a few of them near the temple. There are a few 'kutirs' (huts) along the forest route of the Ganga trail. But not sure whether they will allow outsiders to stay there. There are some lodges on the way to the temple. The fare starts from 150 Rs/- for double rooms(the ones with very basic facilities). If you can trek along the Ganga route you will find lot of places inside the forest where you can safely put up your tent. It is an awesome experience to sleep on the banks of roaring ganges viewing the himalayan ranges. </p>
<b>PS</b>: There are absolutely no ATM facilities in and around Gangotri. The nearest ATM is around 30 kms away on the way from Uttar kashi to  Gangotri although it is not functional most times. So in order to avoid any risks, you should carry enough money in hand with you from Uttar Kashi onwards.
      
      
        
                <h3>Best time to visit:</h3>

            
<p>As mentioned earlier, Gangotri, Gaumukh and other major himalayan pilgrim centres will be closed from November to first week of May. Right after the opening ceremony day, lot of devotees come to the shrine and it is a pretty good time to visit the place and climb up towards Gaumukh.</p>

<h2 style="width:150px;position:relative;top:10px;">Badrinath</h2>


            <p style="position:relative;top:2px;"><b>Badrinath</b>  is one of the most popular and holiest shrines of the Hindus in India. Located in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand, it is the most important of the four holy places (Char Dham pilgrimage). It has got an average elevation of around 10,200 ft and situated on the banks of river <b>Alaknanda</b>. Badrinath got its name from the temple which is dedicated to the Badri Narayana (Lord Vishnu). The temple was established as a major pilgrimage spot by Adi Shankaracharya in 9th century AD, though it has been repeatedly destroyed due to earthquakes and avalanches after that. But after each of these calamities the temple has been rebuilt and has been seeing increasing number of visitors every year. The temple and the mountain ranges as well as the Alaknanda river which is flowing through the town have special places in Hindu puranas and myths. The <b>Nar</b> and <b>Narayana</b> (believed to be the incarnations of lord  Vishnu) mountain ranges are considered to be scared as per the myths and mentions in scared books associated with them.</p>

<p>Badrinath is a major gateway to several mountaineering and trekking expeditions towards the mountain ranges like  <b>Neelaknt parbat</b>. The view of Neelkanth peak from Badrinath temple is an unbelievable experience especially when the mountain range is illuminated by evening sun. The whole town of Badrinath lies between the Nar and Narayana mountain ranges and is 9km from the Neelkanth peak. From Badri, you can head further towards other beautiful and tranquil himalayan villages and towns like Mana (4 km), Swarg cave etc.. There are many unexplored and very thinly populated villages and spaces around Badri even now. The town is only a few kilometres from the Indo-China(Tibet) border.</p>
         
              <h3>How to reach:</h3>

             
<p><b>Rishikesh</b> is the base city and nearest railway station for most of your expeditions towards this part of the world. It is 301 km from Badri. The nearest airport is Jolly Grant airport near Dehradun which is 317 km from Badri. There are regular bus services( State transport corporation buses as well as private coaches) operating from Delhi to Badri connecting Rishikesh as well as Haridwar.  Badri is generally a 2 days long journey from Kedarnath which is another holy spot in the  Char dham circuit. The road to Badri will be extremely crowded due to pilgrims going to different destinations like Hemkund Sahib which is a major shrine for Sikhs. </p>
           <p>If you are going from Rishikesh, it is better to have a halt in <b>Joshimath</b>  which is 255 km away from Rishikesh on the way to Badri. It takes around 7.5 hours to reach JoshiMath from Rishikesh. Many people choose to start from Joshimath early morning, have the darsan of Badri Narayana by travelling around 45 kms (2 hours 15 minutes), and by evening come back to JoshiMath to avoid any altitude problems. During the pilgrim season, you will get buses to Badri via JoshiMath from Rishikesh bus stand. The bus fare would be around 400 Rs/-. You can take shared taxis also from Rishikesh Tehri stand which will cost around 450 Rs/- per person.</p>




        
         
         
               <h3>Accommodation & Food:</h3>
            

<p> There are lots of Ashrams in Badrinath which provide accommodation as well as food at a very nominal price. You can depend on these especially if you are low on budget. The major ones are 
<ol>
<li><b>Manav kalyan ashram</b>:  At temple road Just above Alaknanda river. Clean and spacious rooms and bathrooms.</li><br /><br />

 <li><b>Bholagiri ashram</b>: At NH 58, Badrinath. Open for all pilgrims. basic facilities.</li><br /><br />

 <li><b>Badrikashrama Vanamali ashram</b>: Near Badrinath temple. Bhandharas (free food for pilgrims) are there.</li><br /><br />

  <li><b>Andhra ashram</b>: Near the temple. Run by South Indian trust. Rooms at very affordable price.</li></ol><br />

 Hotels are also available in the town. You are allowed to put up your tents and camp here. So go ahead and explore that option.

Remember that non vegetarian food items are not allowed on the pilgrimage route beyond Rishikesh. There are many  small and medium size restaurants around the temple. All these shops will be closed when the pilgrimage is closed (October to May).  </p>

      
      
        
                <h3>Best time to visit:</h3>

            
<p> The town and the shrine will be closed from October to May first week. The opening and closing dates are informed through media. May to June and again from September to October are the best periods to visit. You can expect cool and chilly whether throughout the year. Winter is severe and there will be snowfall.

 <h2 style="width:150px;position:relative;top:10px;"> Girnar Hills</h2>


            <p style="position:relative;top:2px;"><b>Girnar mountains</b> also known as Girinagar (land of mountains) are one of the most beautiful destinations as well as pilgrim spot in Gujarat. Famous for the presence of the Dattatreya temple (Hindus believe that the Avadhootha Dattatreya who is considered to be the joint incarnation of Brahma,Vishnu and Siva stayed here.) and the Jain temple, Girnar is surrounded by the exquisite Gir forest and is older than the Himalayas. It is just 1.5 hours away from the world famous <a style="color:rgb(100,150,0);text-decoration:underline;" title="Find more about Somnath temple" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somnath_temple" target="_blank"><b>Somnath Temple</b></a> . It will be a good idea for you to include the Somnath temple also in your travel plan. The climb to the top of the mountain range involves covering more than <b>10,000</b> steps on the way. The time taken will vary from three to five hours depending upon the speed of climbing. The climb presents the visuals of the forest range as well as ancient temples built on the rock. And once you reach the top, you have the view of the beautiful mountain tops lying one after another. You have to take the same route itself to come down. The climbing down will be faster though it may still take 1.5 hours. There are Doly services( People carrying you in a chair) for those who can't climb up.</p>

               <h3 style="position:relative;top:6px;">How to reach:</h3>


               <p style="position:relative;top:2px;">The nearest town as well as railway station is <b>Junagadh</b>. Girnar hills basement is around <b>4 km</b> away from Junagadh railway station. If you are coming from a far away place, you can reach bigger city like Ahmedabad and from there you will easily get train passing through Junagadh. As it is the case with all the hill stations, your best option would be to reach the place early morning. It will take approximately <b>6.5 to 8 hours</b> for you to reach Junagadh from Ahmedabad depending upon the train you catch. In fact there is a train which starts from Ahmedabad Junction railway station at <b>10:05PM (Somnath Express)</b> which will reach Junagadh by <b>4:30 AM</b> in the morning and is chosen by most travellers. If you are travelling in the General compartment, please reach the Ahmedabad station at least by 9PM so that you may get a seat in the general berth.
<a style="color:rgba(0,245,0,.8);text-decoration:underline;" title="Check trains to Junagadh" href="http://indianrailinfo.com/arrivals//1780" target="_blank">Check trains touching Junagadh</a></p>

                <p>Buses-both public as well as private- are also plying from major cities of Gujarat, especially Ahmedabad. Lots of tour operators have their buses running in this route covering Somanath temple also. So after visiting Girnar hills, you can catch a bus to the Somnath temple.</p>
<img title="One of the old temples on the way" style="border:1px solid green;width:250px;height:300px;position:relative;left:250px;top:10px" src="/photos/Girnar/10384749_10204498724480773_7423623729254681707_n.jpg"/>

               <h3 style="position:relative;top:6px;">Accommodation & Food:</h3>
            
<p>The cheapest mode of accommodation of course would be to put up a tent on top of the hills. If you start climbing in the morning, you can easily reach the top before noon. After viewing the sunset, you can put up the tent on top of the hill. You can start climbing down the next morning after viewing the sunrise, although this option would be safer if you are travelling in a group. There are very limited facilities for bathing and toilet purpose. Please take this also into account while planning your schedule. There is no other lodging facility available on top of the hill. So if you are not fine with the tent,its better to climb down the same day. There are lodges available in Junagadh town near the railway station.There are lots of tea shops on the way up as well as on top of the hill which charge almost the same fare as the the shops in the base.So you don't have to carry your food along with you.</p>
        
      
         
               <h3>Best time to visit:</h3>
            
<p>Girnar mountains are open for travellers throughout the year.Climbing will be harder during the mansoon season hence you will be better of avoiding this period. Lot of devotees come to visit the pilgrim center during the Maha Shivaratri period(April) so the place will be crowded during this period. Bhandaras(Food offered for free to the devotees by persons and trusts) will be running during this period.</p>

<h2 style="width:150px;position:relative;top:10px;">Gulmarg</h2>


            <p style="position:relative;top:2px;"><b>Gulmarg</b> is considered to be the heartland of winter tourism in India. Situated around 56 km away from Srinagar in the state of Jammu and Kashmir , this heavenly hill station attracts tourists from all over the world. Considered to be one of the finest skiing destinations in the world, Gulmarg often is the venue for some high profile winter sports activities. Covered fully with snow throughout the year, the meadows of Gulmarg is the home for wild flowers such as daisies and butter cups. The meadows have various small parks and small lakes also and are surrounded by forests of pine and fir. The cable cars will take the tourists from the basement to the top and back.</p>
<img title="snow-clad Gulmarg ranges" style="border:1px solid green;width:250px;height:300px;position:relative;left:110px;top:15px;" src="/photos/Gulmarg/DSC_1187.JPG"/>

                           <p>Though the militancy in Kashmir sector affects the flow of tourists in between, Gulmarg is one of the a few spots in Kashmir which is not flooded with army. Skiing and other winter sports activities are carried out on the slopes of <b>Apharwat</b> peak which is at a height of around 14,000ft. There are many view points in the peak which present you with panoramic views of <b>Nanga Parbat</b> and <b>Hasmukh mountains</b>.</p>



         
               <h3 style="position:relative;top:10px;">How to reach:</h3>


               <p style="position:relative;top:2px;">The nearest railway station is <b>Jammu Tawi</b> which is at a distance of around 300 km from Gulmarg. The nearest airport is Srinagar which is 56 km away. Almost all tourist destinations in Kashmir are connected by taxis and the fare is fixed by taxi unions ( you can see the fares on boards placed in each taxi stand). And to be honest, the txt rates are very reasonable especially if you have a group of 4 or 5 members. For example, the taxi from Dal lake to Gulmarg (63 km) will cost you around 2050 Rs/-(To and from-including the waiting charge). It will take 1.5 hours for the taxis to reach Gulmarg from Dal. The roads in Srinagar have been reconstructed and widened recently and are in very good conditions.If you don't want to spend that much money on private taxis or if you are travelling alone or in very small groups, you can depend upon the shared cab services (called Sumo services by local people) which connect most of the tourist spots and small towns. <u>Do not</u> depend upon the local mini buses as they consumes too much time and move very slowly. If you plan to visit the other major tourist spots like Pahalgam, Sonmarg, Dal lake and various Mughal gardens (which are beautiful) , it will be a better idea to hire taxis especially if you are short on time.</p>


          <p>Now about the climb. As mentioned earlier, ropeway cable cars (Gulmarg Gondolas ) are running one after another to and from connecting the basement and Abharwat peak. Pony service is also available price of which vary depending upon your negotiation capability. Almost all the tourists depend on these. Other that the extreme peak spot, there is an intermediate destination , where you will find lot of tourists as well as skiing freaks. If you are interested in snow bike riding or skiing, you can negotiate with any of the large number of agents and guides who are roaming around in these destinations . You can book your tickets online also (for both Cable cars as well as various sports activities.) to avoid the long queues  at the ticket counters. The ticket prices vary according to the season. <a style="color:rgba(0,245,0,.8);text-decoration:underline;" title="Book Gondola tickets online" href="http://gulmarggondola.com" target="_blank">For booking tickets online:</a></p> 

            <p>However, if you are ready for the adventure of walking along the snow clad hill, please go ahead although you wouldn't find much company other than some local people and the pony service operators.  In fact, it is not a hard task to climb from the basement to the intermediate destination , especially in summer when you can walk along the sideway paths which are devoid of snow. However, it is a very difficult task to climb from there to the peak and you can take the cable cars from the station available there to the top.

               <h3 style="position:relative;top:6px;">Accommodation & Food:</h3>
            
<p>Threre are some small resorts and apartments run by various parties in the Gulmarg base which may be a little expensive if you are a budget traveller. You can find accommodations and lodgings in the nearby towns. You need to present a valid identity proof in all these places.</p>
        
                 There are two or three food courts running at the first point. In fact two of them are pretty big. Many tea and coffee shops are also there which sell local snacks as well as other eatables. The food will be a little expensive on top as you can expect. For example one small cup of tea will cost you 20 bucks.
         
               <h3>Best time to visit:</h3>
            
<p>Gulmarg will be covered with snow throughout the year and hence attracts tourists all seasons. However, winter is the peak season for Gulmarg. Tourists as well as winter sports freaks come here from all over the world. The view from the peaks are simply  mind-blowing during winter. You should be prepared with enough warm clothes including jackets and boots.</p>

               <h2 style="width:150px;position:relative;top:10px;">Kalpeswar</h2>


            <p style="position:relative;top:2px;"><b>Kalpeswar</b> is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva located at an elevation of 7,217.8 ft in the Urgam valley in the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand. This is the fifth temple of the  <a style="color:rgb(100,150,0);text-decoration:underline;" title="Find more about Panch Kedar" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panch_Kedar" target="_blank"><b>Panch Kedar</b></a>. Kalpeshwar is the only Panch Kedar temple accessible throughout the year. At this small stone temple, approached through a cave passage, the matted tress (jata) of Lord Shiva is worshipped. Hence, Lord Shiva is also called as Jatadhar or Jateshwar. It is approachable only by 12 km trekking from the nearest road head of <b>Helong</b> on the Rishikesh-Badrinath road. The temple priests at this temple are the Dasnamis and Gossains, disciples of Adi Shankara.</p>

<p>The Kalpeshwar temple is near Urgam village (2 km short of the temple). On the bridle path from Helang to Kalpeshwar, the confluence of the Alaknanda and Kalpganga rivers is seen. Kalpganga river flows through the Urgam valley. The Urgam valley is a dense forest area. The valley has apple orchards and terraced fields where potato is grown extensively.</p>







         
              <h3>How to reach:</h3>

             
<p> Access to Kalpeshwar by road up to Urgam is from Rishikesh, a distance of 253 km on the Rishikesh-Badrinath road. Earlier the trek route existed from Helang to Kalpeshwar via Urgam village for a distance of 10 km (6.2 mi). But now a good jeep-able road is constructed from Helang to Urgam, so from Urgam it's just 2 km trek to reach Kalpeshwar. The nearest airport is at Jolly Grant, Dehradun at a distance of 272 km and the nearest railhead, Rishikesh, is 255 km. Boodha Kedar temple surrounded by potato fields is seen on the trek route. Also seen is the Dhyan Badri temple at Urgam Village, one of the Sapt Badri (seven Badri) temples.</p>
        
         
         
             <h3>Accommodation & Food:</h3>
            

<p> Home stay options are available in Kalpeswar. You will get fresh hygienic homemade food in these. You can stay at the temple dharamshala also. Consider putting up your tents also in a safer region which is not affected by wind.

 <h2 style="width:150px;position:relative;top:10px;">Kedarnath</h2>


            <p style="position:relative;top:2px;"><b>Kedarnath</b> temple is one of the most popular and holiest shrines of Hindus in India. It is the most remote of the Chota Char dham circuit. Kedarnath temple is part of the <a style="color:rgb(100,150,0);text-decoration:underline;" title="Find more about Panch Kedar" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panch_Kedar" target="_blank"><b>Panch Kedar</b></a> circuit also. Located in the Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand, near Chorabari glacier, average elevation of Kedarnath is about 11,755 ft above sea level in the Himalayas. Kedarnath is close to the source of river <b>Mandakini</b> and the entire town is situated on the shores of the river. Kedarnath is one of the 12 Jyothirlingas. </p>

<p>Kedarnath town underwent massive destruction in the flash floods happened in Uttarakhand in 2013. The reconstruction works started pretty quickly and is still going on as result of which the town as well as the temple is open for devotees.  Just like other char dham destinations, Kedarnath also will be closed from October to the first week of May (till around May 10th). In fact during the period of snowfall (November to April), nobody stays in Kedarnath and the entire town will be closed as people shift to other places.The main attraction of Kedarnath is the view of the majestic himalayan peaks behind the temple like Kedarnath peak (22,769 ft) and Kedar dome (22,411 ft) and others. Dedicated to the Lord Siva, Kedarnath temple attracts lots of devotees every year. The temple was refurbished by Adi Shankaracharya in the 8th century AD. His samadhi sthal( eternal resting place ) is behind the temple. </p>

              <h3>How to reach:</h3>

             
<p>The nearest roadhead to Kedarnath town is <b>Gaurikund</b> which is 17 km away from Kedarnath. From Gaurikund you have to climb up. Gaurikund is well connected to <b>Rishikesh (223 km, nearest railway station ), Kotdwar, Dehradun (239 km), Haridwar (240 km)</b> and other important himalayan hill stations. There are bus as well as taxi services (shared as well as private ones ) plying from Rishikesh,Haridwar as well as Dehradun to Gaurikund. The bus fare from Rishikesh is around 350 Rs/- and the share taxi will cost you 400 Rs/- per person. As mentioned earlier, the road ends in Gaurikund and from there starts the 17 km trek. There are horse service as well as palanquins available for those who can't climb. Doli service (4 persons carrying you in a chair) is also available. During peak season, helicopter service is also organised by Pawan hans helicopter service. If you are coming from Rishikesh/Haridwar side, you can catch the early morning buses from these places. It takes one whole day journey to reach Gaurikund (if there are no landslides ) and the whole 230 odd kilometre ride is extremely beautiful as the route covers regions full of mountains around the beautiful Ganges. The buses, Taxis and other vehicles will go only till Sonprayag which is 5 km from Gaurikund, from where you will have to catch local shared cabs(20 Rs/- per person). So the route is <b>Rishikesh-Rudraprayag-Sonprayag-Gaurikund</b></p>
           <p>There are two parking slots just before Gaurikund where you can get parking slots for your private vehicles if you are lucky, as most of the space will be occupied by taxis. There are mule owners who will start chasing you asking whether you need a mule for the trek. The rate varies from 550 to 800 Rs/-. Make sure that your mule is well rested before you start the very steep climb.  The booking offices for mules and dollis is just half kilometre from Gaurikund towards Kedarnath. There is the option of having a refreshing hot water bath in Gauri Kund hot water spring, although the area can be a bit too crowded sometimes. The older hot water kund got destroyed in the flood and new one is under construction.</p>

         <p> Once you start the climb there will be shops after every 200 meters where you will get tea, coffee as well as some snacks. Halfway up the trek, at a point called Rambara, you will find a GMVN guest house where you can take a break and have food. Remember that the air gets thinner after this point and many people experience breathing trouble between Rambara and and Kedarnath.</p> 



        
         
         
               <h3>Accommodation & Food:</h3>
            

<p> There are hotels and guest houses in Gaurikund. you can get decent double rooms at around 100-300 Rs/- depending upon the season(Although you need to bargain a bit to get the correct fare. )</p>

            <p style="position:relative;top:2px;"><b>Kodachadri</b> also known as Kudajadri is one of the most beautiful destinations for tourists as well as hard core trekkers.Blessed with wide variety of visuals, Kudajadri should be in the list of anyone who loves to be surrounded by the silence and exquisite beauty of nature. Kudajadri is near to the famous <a style="color:rgb(100,150,0);text-decoration:underline;" title="Find more about Mookambika temple" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mookambika" target="_blank"><b>Kollur Mookambika Temple</b></a>  in Karnataka. The temple is a destination for lots of Devi devotees. River <b>Souparnika</b> is flowing elegantly right in front of the temple. Bathing ghats are there and you can have a refreshing dip in the river before and after visiting Kudajadri. Kudajadri hill top is famous for the presence of Saravanja Peetha temple. It is believed that Adi Shankaracharya came to this place and meditated there and established a peetha there.There are two or three other small temples on hill top.</p>

            <h3 style="position:relative;top:15px;">How to reach:</h3>

               <p style="position:relative;top:10px;">Cheapest mode of transportation would be by train (if you are a smart general compartment traveller). Nearest railway stations are <b>Byndoor</b> and <b>Kundapura</b>. Byndoor station is also called Mookambika road station. Best option for you would be to look for a train which will reach Byndoor by early morning. There is a small bus stand outside the railway station from where you will get bus to Kollur temple. Rickshaws are also available from there to the Kollur temple. From kollur you will get buses going to Shimoga. Get into that and after around 25 minutes you will reach the trekking starting point. You just need to tell the bus conductor to drop you there. The trek is approximately 14km. Jeep service is also there from the temple to the top of Kudajadri hills.The jeep service will cost around 500 Rs/- per person.<a style="color:rgba(0,245,0,.8);text-decoration:underline;" title="Check trains to Byndoor" href="http://indianrailinfo.com/arrivals/byndoor-mookambika-road-bynr/1780" target="_blank">Check trains to Byndoor</a></p>

            <h3 style="position:relative;top:15px;">Accommodation & Food:</h3>
            
<p style="position:relative;top:10px;">Kudajadri was a dream spot for hard core trekkers till the beginning of 2015. There were hardly any restrictions from the authorities and you could put up your tent on top of the hill wherever you want and enjoy the beautiful night stay on the hill top. Night trekking was also being chosen by some people as the trekking routes are devoid of any wild animals. But with freedom comes its bad effects. The hill top was used as a spot for liquor parties by some travellers. The littering of waste by the tourists started to make the hill top, especially the area near the Sarvajna peet temple, a sad scene. As a result, the forest department banned putting up tents on top as well as carrying liquor to the top. You will be inspected at the starting point by the officials.But don't worry too much. There is a PWD guest house on top were you will get basic accommodation facility and food (that is, a mattress!) at a cheap rate (around 25 Rs/mattress). The other accommodation available on hill top is the temple priest's house where you will get food also. If you are planning to come back to Kollur the same day, then rooms are available in hotels near the Mookambika temple. To get the maximum out of the Kudajadri trip, you should stay on top of the hill overnight and view both sunset and sunrise from there which are exquisite. You will hear the sound of wind clearly which resembles the sound of waves in ocean, during the night time.</p><p style="color:rgb(100,150,0);text-decoration:underline;">Contact number for PWD guest house,Kodachadri:+91 9242892299/ +91 9449145540</p>

                       <p>You can have you breakfast from Kollur where number of normal restaurants are there. Once you have covered around 6 kms of the trek, there is small tea shop in the middle of the forest<b>(Santhosh Tea shop)</b> which is run by an old couple from Kerala. Santhosh was the name of their only son. After the death of their son, they decided to come to this place and live the rest of their lives there. You can have delicious 'Puttu' and 'Kadala curry' from there for lunch. Tea and some eatables are also available there.On hill top two or three tea shops are there. You can have your dinner from there although the food will be a little more expensive on hill top(Understandably so.) You can consider carrying bread or bananas from the base if you don't want to spend too much money there.</p>
         
      <img title="Hotel Santosh" style="border:1px solid green;width:250px;height:300px;position:relative;left:350px;top:15px;" src="/photos/Kodachadri/10494654_10203583585682875_919431734715189631_n.jpg"/>
        
            <h3 style="position:relative;top:15px;">Best time to visit:</h3>
            
<p style="position:relative;top:10px;">Although it is advised by most people to avoid trekking during monsoon, I would recommend to do the Kudajadri trek (in fact any trek along the forest route) at least once during the monsoon. The beauty of wild increases by many folds by rain and its a heavenly and dreamlike experience to walk through the Kudajadri forest right after the rain. But be extremely careful as the trekking becomes more difficult due to the presence of leeches as well the slippery route. Carry salt or turmeric powder with you to be protected from the leaches. (put it inside and outside your socks as well as on top your shoes.) Please avoid wearing slippers during rainy season and stick to your trekking shoes.If you go to Kudajadri during the winter, you will get to see the magic of mist at its maximum.Peak summer time would not be a good time to visit Kudajadri and should be avoided.

            <p style="position:relative;top:2px;"><b> Madhyamaheswar </b> or Madhmaheshwar is a Hindu temple dedicated to god Shiva, located in the Mansoona village of Garhwal Himalayas in Uttarakhand. Being the second temple in the sacred <a style="color:rgb(100,150,0);text-decoration:underline;" title="Find more about Panch Kedar" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panch_Kedar" target="_blank"><b>Panch Kedar</b></a> circuit, Madhyamaheswar is situated at an elevation of 11,473 ft. The middle ( madhya ) or belly part or navel (nabhi) of the bull, considered a divine form of Shiva, is worshipped at this temple according to the Panch kedar legend. The temple is situated in a lush meadow, just below a high ridge. The older temple called 'Vriddh-Madmaheshwar' temple is a tiny blackened shrine on the ridge, which looks straight up at the commanding Chaukhamba peaks. There are two other smaller shrines, one for Shiva’s consort Parvati and the other dedicated to the Ardhanarishwara, a half-Shiva half-Parvati image. To the right of the main temple there is a small temple where the image of Saraswati, the Hindu goddess of learning, made of marble is installed in the sanctum. The water from the temple precincts is considered so highly sacred . Like all other himalayan destinations, the road to Rudranath is full of heavenly views of peaks and valleys. One has to trek 2 kilometers up the steep ways through large moors and valleys and then would reach in a small lake, where a full Panoramic range of Himalayas consisting of the peaks, Chaukhamba, Kedarnath, Neelkanth, Trishul, Kamet, Panchulli, etc.</p>

<p>The temple is in a picturesque green valley surrounded by snow peaks of Chaukhamba (literal meaning is four pillars or peaks), Neel Kanth and Kedarnath in high Himalayan hill ranges. The Kedar hills, gives a spectacular view of the mountain formation with numerous glaciers which include the source of the Mandakini River. The region has rich flora and fauna, particularly the endangered species of Himalayan monal pheasant and Himalayan musk deer (locally called Kasturi deer) in the Kedarnath Wild Life Sanctuary.</p>

  <h2 style="width:150px;position:relative;top:10px;">Truind Hills</h2>


            <p style="position:relative;top:2px;"><b>Truind</b> Hills are one of the most beautiful as well as most rewarding trekking experience you could ask for. Situated near <b>Dharamsala</b> (Himachal Pradesh),Truind is among the most sought out destinations in Himachal for most tourists, including the people from abroad.You can enjoy the marvellous beauty of the snow-cladded Dhaulodhar mountains from close range here. The top of the hill is a safe spot for putting up your tent and night stay. You can be rest assured of the marvellous view of the sunrise and sunset from the top if you are prepared to stay overnight.Climbing a distance of around 12 to 15kms (3.5-4.5 hours) depending upon the route you take, the trek covers paths filled with flowers as well as scenic himalayan trees.</p>

<img title="Snow-clad region on top" style="border:1px solid green;width:250px;height:300px;" src="/photos/Truind/DSC_1083.JPG"/>


<p>Rated as the no#1 destination near Dharamsala, Truind should be in the bucket list of any trekker. The trek starts from McLeod Ganj where India has given political refugee to His holiness Dalai Lama who is the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists. So after the trek, you could pay a visit to the Buddhist temples in McLeodGanj, as well as wander around the beautiful Tibetan market out there. From Mcleodganj, you could head towards other destinations like </p>


<a style="color:rgb(100,150,0);text-decoration:underline;" title="Find more about Naddi village" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naddi" target="_blank"><b>Naddi village</b></a> (6 km)<br /><br />

<p style="color:rgb(100,150,0);text-decoration:underline;"><b> Dal lake</b> (4 km)</p>


<p>In fact, its a beautiful experience to walk from McLeodganj to Naddi covering St.John's church as well as Dal lake on the way. You can start walking by afternoon and reach Naddi within 2 hours (You can make it faster by taking the steps built as short-cuts). Watch the sunset from  the beautiful Naddi valley and head back towards Mcleodganj.</p>

               <h3>How to reach:</h3>

             
<p>There are multiple routes possible to reach the top of the Truind hills. Many of them starts from McLeodGanj and goes through Dhramkot which is 2 km on the way up. McleodGanj is just 9 km away from Dharamsala. You can get buses at  intervals of 20-25 minutes from Dharamsala to the place. As it is the case with most of the tourist destinations in this part of the country,there are shared cab services running connecting both McLeod Ganj and Dharamsala which charge almost the same rate (20 Rs/person) as the bus service and would make you reach faster. The nearest railway station to Dharamsala is Kangra valley which is around 30.5 km away. There are lots of buses running connecting both these places. If you are planning to reach Kangra by train, then you need to catch a bus to the bus stand from outside the railway station. Once you reach the Kangra bus stand you will get buses to Dharamsala from there. Many tour operators run their schedules connecting major cities of North India and Dharamsala.</p>

        
         
         
               <h3>Accommodation & Food:</h3>
            

<p>As mentioned earlier, Truind top is an ideal spot for putting up your tent and enjoy the marvellous beauty of the Himalayas overnight. So don't miss this opportunity and do carry your tent,sleeping bag as well as warm cloths as the temperature will go down to lower levels during night.There will be snowfall at night on top, so be prepared with your warm cloths.There are two spots where you can put up your tent. First one is after a trek of 11km (3 hours) where you will find many coffee shops as well as one tourism department guesthouse.The spot provides beautiful view of the mountains. Rooms are available at the rate of 500 Rs/person in the guest house. The coffee shops provide tents as well as sleeping mats for rent (starting from 400Rs/-). This where you will find most of the tents of trekkers. However, if you want to go to a quieter place, you can carry on climbing and reach the extreme top after about an hour. There is only one coffee shop out there which is run by a Pandit who is staying on top for the past 21 years. You can get stay inside his coffee shop at night(400 Rs/person). You can put up your tent there and enjoy the beautiful experience of sleeping right at the base of Himalayan ranges. You can play with snow there. So even if you are planning to put up your tent at the first point, I would recommend climbing up till this point and spending some time there.</p>

  <p>As it is the case with most of the trekking spots, the prices of eatables increases as you climb up. On top of the hills, one glass of tea will cost you 40 bucks. It would be a good idea to carry a few Paranthas and other eatables from the base. There are number of coffee shops in regular intervals as you climb up. Some of them are at extremely beautiful view points (Like Magic View coffee shop). You can refill your water bottles (20Rs/Litre) with Mineral water from Magic view coffee shop, which is around 7km up.So no need to stock too many water bottles.</p>
      
      
        
                <h3>Best time to visit:</h3>

            
<p>The entire Dharmsala region would be covered with snow during winter. So there is no need to explain the scenario of Truind. If you want to experience the snow at its maximum, winter would be the ideal time. Still you can have a rewarding experience of the trek at any other time of the year.In fact, towards the beginning of May, you can climb still further up towards a cave.

<p>Other than being a major pilgrim destination, Tungnath provides an opportunity for a good trekking experience.  The trek starts from the base <b>Chopta</b> and is 4.5 km long.Chopta is known as 'Mini Switzerland of India' because of its beautiful valleys and view of different mountain peaks. Of all the panch kedar trek route, Tungnath trek is the shortest though it may still take about 1.5-2 hours to cover this distance depending upon your physical capability. But it will be one of the most rewarding treks ou can undertake as the views of cliffs and valleys will simply fill your heart. From the top of Chandrasila peak, picturesque views of himalayan ranges including the snow peaks like Nanda devi, Banderpoonch, Kedarnath, Chaukamba and Neelkanth are visible on one side and the beautiful Garhwal valley on the other side. There is a high-altitude botanical university (under Garhwal university) here. The Kedarnath wild life sanctuary or Kedarnath musk deer sanctuary which was set up to preserve the endangered musk deer species, is also situated in this region. Just like all the other main himalayan shrines, Tungnath temple also will be closed during the period of October to May first week (around May 10th). You can still trek along this route to view the beautiful snow clad mountains. The forest department will charge you around 150 Rs/- during winter period.</p>

<h2 style="width:150px;position:relative;top:10px;">Uttar Kashi</h2>


            <p style="position:relative;top:2px;"><b>Uttar Kashi</b> is a  camping as well as pilgrim spot on your way to Gangotri from Rishikesh. It is <b>170 km</b> away from Rishikesh. The meaning of the name is Kashi (Varanasi) of north. It is situated on the banks of river <b>Bhagirathi</b> (Ganges) and lies near a hill called <b>Varun Parvat</b> which is on the confluence of two rivers Varuna and Asi.

Nowadays , massive reconstruction works are going on in Uttar Kashi as an effort to recover from the disastrous flood happened in 2012 , which demolished the whole town. In fact the people of this land have suffered many natural disasters like 1991 earthquake, landslide in 2003 and flood in 2012-2013 period other than minor landslides which keep happening every now and then which sometimes isolates the place from outside world. Most of the experts are of the opinion that the flood and landslides are the result of extremely unscientific construction works which occurred in the district during all these years. Uttar Kashi is the center of the famous <b>Nehru Institute of Mountaineering</b>.</p>




<p> Other than the temples and ashrams, Uttar kashi district has got some fresh water lakes like Dodital and Nachiketa Tal ( remember Nachiketa of 'Kathopanishad') and many dams also.

<p>The temple is open to the devotees throughout the year. However, if you want to avoid too much rush and crowd, you can choose the days after Navratri(mid April) or after Diwali. It will be a bit cold on top of the hill in the evening in all seasons. So you will be better of carrying a few warm clothes.
